PCW can be found by going on this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IXd9ynASqSysawlYGTZYdTqJWjcqHN2vC8vyMlwJ_Pk/edit?usp=sharing

Since the PCW was not an ipynb file, I did not know if I should add to github but since the professor did not ask for any link during class I am adding it here too. It is beyond the submission date, but when you go to the document you will see latest edits are made much in advance of the class proving I did not add anything to the PCW once class had started.
